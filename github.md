Version Control (Git Integration)
GitHub is built on Git, which tracks every change made to your code. You can go back to previous versions, compare edits, and safely experiment without losing work.

Repositories (Repos)
A repository is a project folder stored online. It contains your code, files, documentation, and revision history. Repos can be public (open to everyone) or private.

Collaboration & Pull Requests
Multiple developers can work on the same project. Pull requests let contributors propose changes, review code, discuss improvements, and merge updates safely.

Branching System
Branches allow you to create separate versions of your project to test features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once ready, you merge them back.

Issues & Project Tracking
GitHub provides issue tracking for bug reports, feature requests, and tasks. Teams use it to organize work and manage development progress.

GitHub Actions (Automation / CI-CD)
You can automate workflows like testing, building, and deploying code. This helps ensure your code works correctly every time changes are pushed.

Code Review Tools
Built-in review features allow commenting on specific lines of code, suggesting edits, and approving changes — improving quality and teamwork.

Documentation with README & Wikis
Each repo can include a README file and wiki pages to explain how the project works, how to install it, and how others can contribute.
